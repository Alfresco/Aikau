page.description=A DropDownButton is a button that when clicked will render the configured widget model in a drop-down display. It can be configured with subscription topics that when published will hide the drop-down.
example1.title=Form drop-down
example1.description=In this example a form is rendered inside the drop-down. The 'hideDropDownTopics' array has been configured to include the same topic as the 'okButtonPublishTopic' in the form so that when the form value is published the drop-down will be hidden. Try changing the 'widgets' model to render alternate contents in the drop-down and try changing the 'hideDropDownTopics' configuration so that form confirmation cannot hide the drop-down.
