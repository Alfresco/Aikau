/**
 * This widget is intended purely for the purpose of collecting and submitting code coverage
 * data generated when running widget unit tests. It relies on the source code having been 
 * offline-instrumented using the "node-coverage" (https://github.com/piuccio/node-coverage)
 * application. If instrumentation data is available then this widget can be used to send
 * the coverage data to a node-coverage server.
 * 
 * Because the node-coverage server is likely to be on a different host (mostly because
 * node-coverage is a Node.js application and the widgets will be running on a JEE stack)
 * it is necessary to use a form POST to submit the data cross-origin.
