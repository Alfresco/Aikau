/**
 * This service provides an easy way in which users can be navigated to a specific view containing the
 * node they are interested in. This has been added to support the "document-locate" action that is
 * configured as standard in Alfresco Share but to make the capability available for use in other contexts.
 * Without any additional configuration this service can be used in Aikau pages contained within Alfresco Share,
 * however if you wish to use this in an alternative client (e.g. a standalone client created from the 
 * Aikau Maven Archetype) then it is likely that you will need to set some configuration, e.g. setting
 * [useAikauPages]{@link module:alfresco/core/UrlUtilsMixin#useAikauPages} to be true and
 * setting the [nonSiteUrl]{@link module:alfresco/services/actions/NodeLocationService#nonSiteUrl} and
 * [siteUrl]{@link module:alfresco/services/actions/NodeLocationService#siteUrl} locations to take the 
 * user to.
 *
 * @example <caption>Standard configuration in Share:</caption>
 * {
 *    name: "alfresco/services/actions/NodeLocationService"
 * }
 *
 * @example <caption>Show all nodes in custom Repository view in Share:</caption>
 * {
 *    name: "alfresco/services/actions/NodeLocationService",
 *    config: {
 *       nonSiteUrl: "custom-repository",
 *       siteUrl: null
 *    }
