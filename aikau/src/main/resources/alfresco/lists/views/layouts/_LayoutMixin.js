/**
 * This mixin module extends [CoreWidgetProcessing]{@link module:alfresco/core/CoreWidgetProcessing} to provide
 * some additional identification processing for widgets in the alfresco/lists/layouts package. This is necessary to ensure
 * that an "id" attribute can be given to an widget in the alfresco/renderers package and for that attribute to be
 * updated to include the index of the current item. This is required because the renderers and list layout controls
 * are typically used when iterating over multiple items and Aikau ensures that each widget has a unique "id". Therefore
 * in order to be able to use unique identifiers within a page model it is necessary to update the "id" on each iteration
 * to prevent duplications.
