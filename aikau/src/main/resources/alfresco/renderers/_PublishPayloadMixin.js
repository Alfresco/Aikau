/**
 * <p>The _PublishPayloadMixin should be mixed into all modules that perform publications. It provides a consistent
 * way of generating the payload body. There are several different ways of generating a payload which include the 
 * following:</p>
 * <ul><li>configured payload</li>
 * <li>the current item</li>
 * <li>the configured payload processed through one or more modifier functions</li>
 * <li>a new payload built from properties in the current item or a triggering publication payload</li>
 * <li>any of the above with the current item "mixed in"</li></ul>
 * 
 * <p>In the following example one variable called shortName is defined as being sourced from the shortName 
 * property of the currentItem. A second variable called visibility is defined as being the value property 
 * found within the payload.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Example model configuration:</p>
 * 
 * <p><pre>publishTopic: "ALF_DO_SOMETHING",
 * publishPayload: {
 *    shortName: {
 *       alfType: "item",
 *       alfProperty: "shortName"
 *    },
 *    visibility: {
 *       alfType: "payload",
 *       alfProperty: "value"
 *    }
 * }</pre></p>
 * 
 * <p>Widgets mixing in the _PublishPayloadMixin will support the model configuration shown.</p>
