/**
 * <p>This module provides the configuration that can be used for rendering a [menu item]{@link module:alfresco/menus/AlfMenuItem}
 * for the "Manage Aspects" action. The main thing this provides is the "renderFilters" configuration that can be
 * used to determine whether or not the action should be displayed based on the attributes of the "currentItem" (e.g. the Node)
 * that the action is to be used against.</p>
 * <p>It should be possible to upload a new version of a Node when the following is true:
 * <ul><li>The current user does not have WRITE access on the Node</li>
 * <li>The Node is NOT locked</li>
 * <li>The Node is NOT a working copy</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
