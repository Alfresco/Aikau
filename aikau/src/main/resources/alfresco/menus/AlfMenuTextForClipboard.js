/**
 * <p>This widget was written with the intention of making it easy to copy-and-paste text from within a 
 * [drop-down menu]{@link module:alfresco/menus/AlfMenuBarPopup}. It was written to implement the
 * "Quick Share" menu in the Document Library where a user is able to quickly access the link to the shared
 * document from within the menu.</p>
 * <p>It is intended to be placed inside a [cascading menu]{@link module:alfresco/menus/AlfCascadingMenu} so that
 * when a user expands the cascade using the keyboard the text is immediately highlighted so that they can simply
 * use CTRL-C to capture it.</p>
 * <p>Sample configuration: </p>
 * <p><pre>{
 *    name: "alfresco/menus/AlfCascadingMenu",
 *     config: {
 *        id: "MyCascade",
 *        label: "Copy some text...",
 *        widgets: [
 *           {
 *              name: "alfresco/menus/AlfMenuTextForClipboard",
 *              config: {
 *                 id: "MyTextToCopy",
 *                 label: "Copy me: ",
 *                 textForClipboard: "Some sample text"
 *              }
 *           }
 *        ]
