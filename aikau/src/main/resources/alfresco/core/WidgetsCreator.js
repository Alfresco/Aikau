/**
 * <p>This module was created to address the situation where a widget might want to create multiple
 * sets of widgets but process the results in different ways. The [CoreWidgetProcessing mixin]{@link module:alfresco/core/CoreWidgetProcessing}
 * was created in such a way that it would allow individual functions to be easily overridden to
 * customize the widget creation process, and it was originally thought that a widget would
 * only have one child widget construct. However, during subsequent development it was established that
 * a widget might want to construct different sets of child widgets in a different way but it was only possible
 * to override the widget process in one way. This module solves that problem by allowing a widget to always 
 * construct children in the standard. An example of its use can be found in the the [AlfDocumentListView]{@link module:alfresco/lists/views/AlfListView#renderNoDataDisplay}.
