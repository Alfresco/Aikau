/**
 * Provides a "Response Web Design" solution for widgets. This can be mixed in to widget definitions
 * to allow minimum and maximum browser window widths that the widget will be displayed for. The 
 * idea is that different widgets providing the same function are declared in different places within
 * the page model that all have different [minRwdWidth]{@link module:alfresco/core/CoreRwd#minRwdWidth}
 * and [maxRwdWidth]{@link module:alfresco/core/CoreRwd#maxRwdWidth} values configured so that the user
 * is able to use different controls in different functions. For example; a line of menu bar items
 * may have an alternative rendering as a single popup menu bar item.
